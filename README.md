# Pixel-Perfect Quiz (Next.js)

## Overview

This project is a **pixel-perfect frontend implementation** of a quiz application built from a provided Figma design.  
The primary objective of the assignment was to **faithfully translate the design into code**, preserving exact layout, typography, colors, gradients, spacing, and animations.

Functional complexity such as scoring logic or backend integration was intentionally kept minimal to ensure that **visual accuracy and frontend quality** remained the top priority.
